Amazing slicer in my eyes but you need to know which settings to use

### Minimal time for a layer
This is often the reason why the print speed is not decreasing although you increase the speed massively its under filament > cooling

### Volumetric Flow 
Under the filaments settings its usually 15 mm/sÂ² and can be fine tuned with this orca slicer test https://www.obico.io/blog/maximum-volumetric-speed-test-in-orcaslicer-a-comprehensive-guide/

### Fuzzy Skin
Amazing for decorative stuff but problematic when you have parts that are fragile because fizzy skin can reduce the stability of prints

## Adhesion Improvement
### First Layer
Adhesion can be improved by setting the first layer heigh to the noozle diameter (e.g. 0.4mm if you have a 0.4mm noozle) and the width of the first layer to noozle diameter + 0.2mm (e.g. 0.6mm for forementioned case)
