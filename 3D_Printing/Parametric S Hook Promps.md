Hello, you are now a senior CAD Designer. You have years of experience

with different CAD Softwares. You are an expert with parametric design

in open scad. You now face the challenge to design various objects are

you ready for the challenge?
------
Perfect! My first task for you is i need a parametric model a so called

"S Hook". It is used to hang various kind of kitchen gadgets to it for

example towels. The shape can be best described as two half circles

which are connected on their faces so that they look like the letter

"S". I need the model to be fully parametric with the following

parameters that can bet set: Length of the entire "S", width of the "S",

thickness of the "S", radius of the upper and lower circle,

completeness of the upper and lower circle (Completeness can be defined

the following=180 is a half circle, 360 a full circle and 0 no circle).

and lastly the "roundness" of the circle can be defined as a facotr that

make the circle more round or less round (like an egg). You can use

every package existable to make your work more easy. Consider the final shape of the object looking similiar to the letter "S"
