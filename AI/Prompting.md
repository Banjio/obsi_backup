## The structure of a good prompt

A good prompt should have the following structure in the following order: 

- **Examples:** Sample inputs/outputs to guide the expected response.
* **Additional Information:** Background or context that informs the task.
- **Role (Persona):** The perspective or tone the AI should adopt.
* **The Directive:** The main instruction or task.
- **Output Formatting:** Specifications for how the response should be structured.

Note that depending on the case not all elements are highly relevant.
