# 2. Known Problems

## Bluemann

__Problem__: Not working by default -> Ressource not available Error message

__Solution__:

## Nvidia Drivers

* On my older pc i have a nvidia card which is not supported by newer drivers.
* To downgrade use `sudo mhwd -a pci nonfree 0300` selecting the correct version for you
* It may be neccessary to remove the existing driver first `sudo mhwd -r pci`

If this does not help try: I have an older graphic card and thus had to downgrad the driver for a more stable experience (Go to manjaro settings and then i choose bumblebee 390 as only other viable option)
## Visual Studio Code

Depending on the version your using, the setting sync is no longer working (Apparently this is also the case in the newest version for code-bin). Then use the extension

```sh
$ ext install Shan.code-settings-sync
```

### Solution for Binary packages

Install 

```sh
$ sudo pacman -S gnome-keyring libsecret libgnome-keyring   
```

Additionally xdg-utils may be neccessary which is not installed on all manjaro installations
